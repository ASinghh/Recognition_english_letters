# Recognition_english_letters
I took up this project and related course to strengthen my understanding of computer vision. In my last project of handwritten digit recognisition, I found that using SVM with PCA gave better result then Neural Networks. I was pretty confident that this was due to limited understanding of Neural Networks. In this project I explored many improvements such as L2 regularization, exponentially decaying step size, multiple hidden layers, dropouts and convolutions. I also applied a simple Logistic regression model to compare the results.

1.Downloaded the data and processed into image matrix
2.Applied a simple regression model, achieved and test set accuracy of 90.1 %
3.Made a neural network model with 1 hidden layer, GradientDescent Optimizer with fixed step size (0.5) and relu activation
4.Achieved an accuracy of 89.7 %, which was less then the Logistic regression model.
5.increased the hidden layers to 5
6.Introduced dropouts at each layer 7.No. of nodes decreased at each step
7.Introduced dropouts
8.Introduced L2 Regularization
9.Exponentially decaying step size
10.achieved an accuracy of 92.1% 12.Working on convolutions and Maxpooling
